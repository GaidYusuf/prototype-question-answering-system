## Description
This project focuses on building a prototype Question Answering system using the semantic information embedded in a Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) file called "glove.6B.50d_Reduced.csv" (included in the "resources" folder). The system is expected to identify semantic relationships between words and provide semantically close words based on the vector representations.

## Project Overview
The project involves implementing various methods in Vector.java and Glove.java to manipulate and analyse vector representations. The tasks include verifying field and method naming conventions, implementing specific methods, and ensuring code efficiency.

## Files
- Vector.java: Contains methods for manipulating vector representations.
- Glove.java: Includes methods for loading data from the DSM file and implementing semantic embedding.

## Resources
The "resources" folder contains the DSM file "glove.6B.50d_Reduced.csv" and other necessary files for the project.
